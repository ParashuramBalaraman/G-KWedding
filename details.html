        Here are a few key events of a Tamil wedding
      </h2>
      <div class="events-wrapper">
        <div class="event-container">
          <h2>Paalikaisthaapanam</h2>
          <h3>Saving Grains</h3>
          <p>The ceremony begins with the arrival of the groom accompanied by the tholan (bride’s brother). The bride's family receives the groom and garlands him to welcome 
            him and his family. The tholan sprinkled the groom’s feet with water, a gesture lavished on an honoured guest. As a token of affection, the groom gifts the tholan 
            with a gold ring. They both then take their place at the manavarai (wedding altar).</p>

        <div class="event-container">
          <h2>Kanyadhanam</h2>
          <h3>Giving Away The Bride</h3>
          <p>This ceremony is significant as the priest proclaims the genealogy of the groom and bride, invoking the celestial to bear witness. The bride’s mother places the bride’s 
            hands in the palms of the groom. <br>
            The koorai (bride sari) and thali (sacred gold pendant threaded on a gold chain) are blessed and taken around the congregation for blessing, 
            The groom presents the koorai to the bride, who will leave to change into it.</p>

        <div class="event-container">
          <h2>The Thaali Ceremony</h2>
          <h3>The Marriage</h3>
          <p>The bride returns wearing the koorai and garlands the groom. The solemn moment of the wedding arrives when the groom ties the thali around the bride’s neck, 
            accompanied by a crescendo of music (to drown out any inauspicious sounds) and a showering of rice mixed with flower petals.</p>
          <class="itinerary" src="../assets/Wedding Itinerary.png" alt="Wedding Itinerary" >
        </div>
        <div class="event-container">
          <h2>Sapta Padi</h2>
          <h3>Walking Around The Sacred Fire</h3>
          <p>The couple take seven steps around the sacred fire in three rounds with the tholan and tholi. After the first round, the groom places the bride’s right foot 
            on the ammi (granite stone) indicating her steadfastness in the face of life’s adversities. Displaying humility and respect for his bride, he places a 
            metti (silver toe ring) on the right food. After the second round, he repeats this on the left foot.</p>
